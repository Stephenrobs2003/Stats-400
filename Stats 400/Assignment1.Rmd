## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
cars <- read.csv(file="cars.txt", stringsAsFactors =
FALSE)
cars2 <- read.csv(file="cars2.txt", stringsAsFactors =
FALSE)

```

```{r}
cars_tiny <- cars[1:5,c(1, 3, 4, 8)]
cars_tiny
```
```{r}
cars_tiny[2,2] <- cars_tiny[4,4] <- NA
cars_tiny[2,2] <- 0
cars_tiny[4,4] <- "Missing"
cars_tiny
```
```{r}
hist(cars$mpg)
boxplot(cars$cubicinches)
plot(cars$mpg, cars$cubicinches)
```


```{r}
mmnorm.weight <- (cars$weight - min(cars$weight))/(max(cars$weight) - min(cars$weight))
mmnorm.weight



```

```{r}
zscore.weight <- (cars$weight - mean(cars$weight))/sd(cars$weight)
zscore.weight
```


```{r}
mean(cars$mpg)
```


```{r}
sd(cars$mpg)
```

 
```{r}
min(cars$mpg)

max(cars$mpg)

```
